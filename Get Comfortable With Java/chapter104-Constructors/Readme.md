# Constructors

Constructors are used to initialize the object state.
Just like methods constructors also contains a collections of statements.

Rules: 
    1) Constructor has the same name as the class name.
    2) Constructors cannot be abstract, final, static and Synchronized.
    3) Access modifiers can be used in constructor declaration to control its access.


There are 2 types of constructors:

    1) No-argument constructors: Constructor with no argument are called default constructor.
        They provide default values to the objects like 0, null.
    2) Parameterized constructor: If we want to initialize fields of a class with your own values.
