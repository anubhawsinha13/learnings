## Adjacency Matrix

	Adjacency matrix is a way to represent graph as a matrix of booleans.
	Every graph is represented by a matrix of boolean values.
	
	The size of the matrix is VxV where V is the number of vertices.
	and the value of Aij is 0 or 1 based on the existing edge between two vertices.
