## Binary Search Tree

	A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure that has at most two children referred as left child and right child.
	Each node in binary tree contains three elements:
	1) pointer to left child
	2) pointer to right child
	3) data element
	
	Top most element is called the root.
	
	
	Binary search tree is another binary tree with following additional properties:
	
		1) the left subtree of a node contains the node with keys less than the node's key.
		2) The right subtree of a node contains the node which is greater than node's key.
		3) The left and right subtree must also be a binary tree.
		
		
	Application:
		Its main application is search where data is constantly entering/leaving and data needs to be printed in sorted order.
