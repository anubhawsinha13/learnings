## Stack

	Stack is a linear data structure used to store a collections of objects.
	Stacks are typically implemented using linked list.
	
	operations::ADT::Abstract data type of a stack.
		push: operation to add a collection object in a stack
		pop: operation to pop a collection object from the stack.
		peek: operation to just see what the element is there at top of the stack.
		isEmpty()

		LIFO: Recently used object on the cache.
		FIFO: Data retrieved in the order it was entered like a Queue.
		Reverse a word
