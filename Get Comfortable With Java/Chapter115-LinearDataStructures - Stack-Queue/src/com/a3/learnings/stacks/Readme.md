# Implement Stack using array/LinkedList

# Algorithm for implementing stack.

		Algorithm for push operation:
			1) Check if the stack is full.
			2) if the stack is full print the stack overflow error.
			3) if the stack is not full the increment the top and add the element.
			
		Algorithm for pop operation:
			1) Check if the stack is empty
			2) If the stack is empty return the error as Stack is Empty
			3) if the stack is not empty, access the data element that is the top.
			4) decrease the value of top
			5) return success.
