## Collections

		A group of individual objects represented as a single unit.
		
		Two main interfaces of collections:
		java.util.Collections
		java.util.Map
		
		Before collections, group of objects were stored Arrays, Hashtables, Vectors ( OldCollectionsof Objects)
		All of the above formats did not have standard member access interface.
		
		Collections provide common set of interfaces and methods to make the development easier.
		
	# Collections root interfaces:
		1) Set : Dosen't allow duplicates
		2) List : Can contain duplicate and elements are ordered.
		3) Queue : elements in FIFO order
		4) Dequeue: elements can be added and removed at both the ends.
		5) Map : Contains key value pair
