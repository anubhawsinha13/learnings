## Interfaces

	It is a commitment to the code that the method signature and the variable types will not change.
	It is a blueprint of the class or the signature of the object
	Methods declared in the interfaces are by default abstract in nature.

	#Implements - Class uses the implements keyword to implement a class based on signature of an interface.
	
	
	Standards:
		Start the name of the interface with "I" as the first letter to differentiate the interfaces.
