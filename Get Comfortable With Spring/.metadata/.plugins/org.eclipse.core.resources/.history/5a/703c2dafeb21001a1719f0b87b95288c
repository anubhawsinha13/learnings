#Spring Beans


	"Spring Bean": Spring bean is simply another java object.
	                When java object is created by spring container then spring refers to them as spring bean.
	

##Inversion Of Control (IOC)
	Design process of outsourcing the creation and management of a bean.
	The outsourcing is managed by Object Factory. 	
		Object Factory: Spring provides an object factory which provides the objects/beans based on annotation on injections.
		This object factory is called as spring container.
		"Spring Container": Primary function of Spring container:
		                        1) Create and Manage Objects ( Inversion of Control)
		                        2) Inject Object's Dependencies ( Dependency Injection)
	

	
	            There are 3 ways of configuring Spring Container:
	                1) XML configuration file
	                2) Java Annotations
	                3) Java Source Code
