## Bean Configurations

	Topics:
	There are 3 ways of configuring Spring Container:
        1) XML configuration file - list each bean
        2) Java Annotations - XML Component-scan with @Component annotations
        3) Java Source Code - @configuration
                    
     Development Steps:
     	1) Create Java class and annotate with @Component
     	2) add component scanning support with @ComponenetScan
     	3) Read Spring Java configuration class
     	4) Retrieve bean file from the container
